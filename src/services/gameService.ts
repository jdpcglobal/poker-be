/**
 * @fileoverview Game Service — orchestration layer between API/socket handlers
 * and the persistence layer (Mongo) + game engine (pure logic).
 *
 * Responsibilities owned here (not in the model, not in the engine):
 *   - Wallet ↔ seat money transfers, wrapped in Mongo transactions for atomicity.
 *   - Concurrency control via per-desk async mutexes (see `withDeskLock`).
 *   - Game lifecycle: createGame, handlePlayerAction, advanceRound, showdown.
 *   - Username resolution for archive writes (one User.find per showdown).
 *   - Mode-aware behavior: cash mode persists wallets; practice mode skips wallet ops.
 *
 * Engine functions stay pure — they take data, return data. This service is the
 * only place where engine results meet documents and money.
 *
 * Money is INTEGER MINOR UNITS throughout. Mode/currency/buy-in fields are
 * denormalized onto each desk (read `desk.mode`, `desk.currency`, etc. directly
 * — do NOT populate `desk.mode`; it's a string enum, not a reference).
 *
 * Dependency note: `async-mutex` is required (npm install async-mutex). Per the
 * "install at point of use" rule, this is the moment.
